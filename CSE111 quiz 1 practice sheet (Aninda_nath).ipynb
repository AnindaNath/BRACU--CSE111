    " One of the important tasks in computational biology is to find short repeating patterns from DNA sequences. These patterns help the biologists to analyze the functionality of different parts in a living being. As a computer science student, you are asked to write a program that will find all the patterns of a given length from a DNA sequence and their number of presence in that sequence. This information will help to find the dominant pattern of a given length in the sequence. You will also find the dominant pattern. Dominant pattern is the sequence which has maximum occurrence. If there are multiple dominant pattern the program will print “No Dominant Pattern found.” \n",

    "Counter Strike Global Offensive is a first person shooting(FPS) game where in a match 2 teams each with 5 members play against each other in different maps. Let's say there are 2 teams, Team A and Team B. For the first half (15 rounds) Team A will play as terrorists and Team B members will play as counter terrorists. In the second half(15 rounds) Team B will play as terrorists and Team A will play as counter terrorists. The first team to reach 16 rounds will win the match. In order for the terrorist team to win a round they have to plant, defend and explode a bomb at a particular spot or eliminate all the members of the counter terrorist team. In order for the counter terrorist team to win a round, they have to eliminate all the members of the terrorist team or diffuse the bomb that was planted by the terrorist team. Unlike other games, the Most Valuable Player(MVP), can be from any of the two teams regardless of which team wins based on the points calculated from performance of the players. Now you will be given the status of a match between 2 teams as input that will contain performance(Kill, Death, Assist, Bomb Plant, Bomb Defuse, Teammate kill)  of all 10 players of the 2 participating teams. **Each performance category contains points based on following criteria:**\\\n",
